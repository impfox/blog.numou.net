## Welcome to the personal website for Numou the Impfox!

Currently a work in progress. This is where I would like to start blogging on a semi-regular basis, as well as to have my own place where I can post my own written stories. Until recently I relied only on FurAffinity to host my stories and I would like to change that… having my own site where I can post whatever I want is ideal.

The art posted on this website is either commissions I’ve paid for from artists, or gift art. I am not an artist and cannot draw. The writing is my own unless I state otherwise.
