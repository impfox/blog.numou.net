# Tiny Toons: Busting Buster's Blues

It was the middle of January at ACME Looniversity. It had been an
especially cold winter, and the days were short, with the sun having
gone down by 5pm. Some toons relished in the darkness, while others were
especially bothered by it. Buster was part of the latter group. While he
was usually fairly bouncy and in good spirits, this week, he had been
feeling rather down. The blue bunny was lounging on the couch in his
dorm, barely moving, while his roommate Plucky was pacing around,
tapping a metallic pen against a notebook, trying to think of new
cartoon gags.

"Soooo, I can't decide between having a piano fall on my head, or
maybe a falling safe," Plucky said, looking up from his book. "What do
you think, Buster?"

"Oh, uh, the safe, I guess." The blue rabbit's voice was slow and
disinterested.

"Uhhh, okay," Plucky said, raising his eyebrows. "You feeling okay?
Usually you have something more insightful to say."

"I'm fine," Buster said, not bothering to look at the green duck as
he spoke to him. He just kept his eyes glued to the ceiling. "Just
tired."

"You've been tired all week. Did you stay up late last night?"

"No. I went to bed early last night, actually." Buster yawned and
started stretching, sprawling along the couch in the process. "And the
night before that."

The duck continued pacing around the couch, tapping the pen rhythmically
against the notebook. "Ooh, I know what it could be. I have my
headphones too loud at night - it's keeping you awake. I'll make sure
to turn my music down a few notches when we go to bed. See? I'm not
ALWAYS only thinking of myself, you know." Plucky puffed his chest out
proudly, as if he was doing some generous deed.

Buster just rolled his eyes and shook his head. "Nah. I can barely hear
it."

Plucky's pride deflated quickly. "Oh, well - you never know, those big
satellite ears of yours could be picking up the sounds, and you don't
even realize it!"

Buster groaned. "That's not how it works, dummy."

The green duck took the casual insult as if it were a challenge. "Oh
yeah? And who are you calling a dummy, carrot brain?"

Buster just rolled his eyes again, and didn't give a response. This
caused Plucky to repeat himself. "Who are you calling a dummy, carrot
brain? Huh? Huh?" It was clear that Plucky was looking to stir up an
argument, maybe even just for something to do, but Buster wasn't having
it. "Hey, I'm talking to you, blue boy."

"Yeah, I know you are, and I'm ignoring you," Buster said plainly.
"I'm not in the mood for this right now, Plucky."

The green duck walked in front of the blue bunny on the couch, looking
down at him, almost in concern. "Then, mister sad boy, what ARE you in
the mood for?" Plucky waited a moment for a response. He only got more
silence as a reply. The duck leaned down to look Buster in the eye.
"Buster, as part of my duty and obligation as roommate and frenemy, I
implore you, please, tell me what I need to do to get bouncy and
annoying bunny boy back."

Buster sighed. "I'm not sad, Plucky."

"Could've fooled me."

Buster looked away from Plucky. He didn't like being the center of
attention. He just wanted Plucky to leave him alone. "I don't know. I
just... feel down."

"Why? Is this because I ate your candy bar last week? I said I was
sorry. I even offered you a dollar towards a new one. I could've offered
you just a quarter, but I'm not a total cheapskate."

Buster shook his head. "No, Plucky, I'm not upset about that." He
thought to himself for a moment. "I guess it's the winter. It's so
dark and cold out. I just want to stay in bed."

Plucky looked down at Buster, and then back to his notepad. He began
writing into it. "To do: Make Buster annoying again," he said out
loud. "Step 1: get Buster off the couch."

"I heard that," the rabbit said flatly. "And how do you plan on doing
that?"

"I'm not sure yet," Plucky said. "I'll think of something. I could
drag you off by your feet, I guess. But then you'd probably kick me in
the face." Plucky snapped his fingers and smiled as he thought of an
idea. "I know! Why don't we go to the arcade? We haven't done that in
a while."

Buster thought to himself for a moment, then shook his head. "Nah, too
crowded. And I don't feel like driving anywhere."

Plucky frowned at the lack of enthusiasm from his roommate. He looked
back down at the seemingly depressed blue bunny. Buster was sprawled out
along the length of the couch, with his red hoodie riding up a bit,
exposing a bit of his belly and torso. Plucky studied the sight before
him for a moment, before an idea popped into his mind. He crossed out
where he had written "arcade" on his notepad, and below it, he wrote,
"Attempt #2: Pestering prodding."

"Alright buddy, if that's how you want to play it\..." Plucky put
down his notepad but kept his pen in hand. The pen was one of those
fancy fountain pens that Babs or Sweetie would call 'bougie'. While it
had a sharp tip on one end, the other end was metallic and round, and
cool to the touch. He leaned down, looming over the blue bunny, and with
the chilly metallic body of the pen, he jabbed in gently and curiously
into one of Buster's exposed sides. This earned him a short squeak and
a slight jerk of movement from the rabbit, who then frowned up at the
duck.

"Don't," Buster growled, meekly tugging his hoodie down.

Plucky raised an eyebrow at the reaction, and poked at Buster's side
again, getting a similar, yet more irritated, reaction from the blue
bunny. He even shivered a bit! This earned Plucky a smack to the
forehead from Buster's hand. "N-NUH, why is it so cold?!" the rabbit
grumbled. "It tickles!"

The green duck grinned. "Oh, I know," he said, as he jabbed the rabbit
in the side with the pen again. "Don't mind me, I'm just getting my
money's worth out of this thing."

Buster kicked his leg out in response, which Plucky dodged. "I mind it
very much, actually!" the rabbit said, still not bothering to sit up.

"Hmm, cold reception. Guess I'll have to get my feathers dirty,"
Plucky said with a smile, dropping his pen on the coffee table. He stuck
out his index finger on each hand, wiggling them tauntingly. "You have
until the count of three to get up, or else." He bent over a bit,
moving closer to Buster, and wiggled his feathers more threateningly.
"One\..."

"Or else what?" Buster said, looking away defiantly, but also folding
his arms over his sides to guard them.

Plucky just smiled. "Two\..."

Buster pulled his feet in a bit, ready to kick out if necessary. "I'm
not moving. You can't make me."

"Three." The duck's hands went for the rabbit's sides, wiggling his
green plumy fingers against the exposed blue fluff.

Buster's arms were no match, and immediately shot up towards the
ceiling, as he let out a squealing laugh. His feet kicked out in defense
as well, but the duck, well prepared, hopped right over his feet, and
landed beside him on the couch.

"Time's up, buddy!" Plucky said. With his roommate no longer holding
his sides, the green duck's fingers went to work, scribbling against
the rabbit's now exposed torso. He was quite pleased with the results -
Buster was indeed laughing, but it was much higher pitched and squeakier
than he had expected. He made a mental note of this reaction, which he
would surely exploit again in the future. Plucky then moved a hand under
one of the rabbit's arms, wiggling his fingers along the sensitive fur
there.

"AHAHAHAHA! P-PLUHUHUHUCKY!" Buster shouted, squirming about, and
trying to push the duck's arm away.

"Aw, does this tickle?" Plucky asked in an innocent, sing-song voice
as he wiggled his fingers under Buster's other arm, enjoying the fact
that he was getting such a big reaction with just one hand. The rabbit
squealed in response. "You know, all you have to do is get up, and
I'll stop," the green duck said with a smirk.

"NEVER!" Buster shouted defiantly between his laughs, still squirming
and kicking.

"Have it your way, then," Plucky said, and moved his free hand to the
rabbit's stomach. Buster was laughing pretty hard already, but when the
green duck started spidering his fingers across his tummy, he really
started to lose it. His laugh was high and shrill, and his legs kicked
wildly, and his hands balled up into fists. After a minute, his laughing
started to get breathless, and Plucky could tell his buddy was starting
to tire out, so he slowed his movements down to a gentle wiggle.

"Still not gonna get up?" Plucky asked, smiling and wiggling his
fingers under the rabbit's arms, albeit at a slower pace. "Cause I
could do this all night."

Buster shook his head. "Nah\...naahaha!"

"Well, alright, then," Plucky said, shrugging his shoulders and
resuming the tickling at a faster speed again, scribbling his hands over
Buster's sides and tummy. "You know, I was gonna ask if you wanted
pizza for dinner, but maybe we could try *RIBS* instead!" The duck
punctuated the word with a squeeze to each of the rabbit's ribs, which
got a squeal of a laugh from Buster.

"STAHAHAHAHAHAP!" the bunny squeaked, flailing his limbs about. "I
CAHAHAHAN'T TAHAHAHKE IT!"

Plucky began spidering his fingers across the rabbit's ribcage,
smirking and chuckling as he did so. "Oh yeah? Getting a li'l ticklish
there, bunny boy?"

"YEHEHEHEHES!" Buster said, trying to wriggle out from under the
duck's grasp, but failing to get anywhere.

"Well, you're the one that wanted to stay here all day. If I were you,
I'd start thinking of a way to get me to stop." Plucky was having fun
and was smiling from ear to ear. "But if you wanna stay here all day, I
can tickle you all day, too."

Buster's eyes started watering a bit. "PLEHEHEHEHEASE!" he squeaked.
"I GIHIHIHIVE! I GIHIHIVE!"

"Ha ha, good choice!" Plucky exclaimed, stopping his movements. He sat
up, and looked down at the rabbit, who was panting, and had a hand on
his forehead. Plucky chuckled, and leaned towards him with a smirk. "I
know, I know, I'm a comedic genius. You don't have to thank me,
really. I'm just that good."

Buster looked up at him, and frowned, blushing a bit. "Yeah yeah, VERY
funny. You're a real knee-slapper." He sat up and wiped his face with a
sleeve of his hoodie, looking away from the green duck. Plucky snorted,
amused. The blue bunny pulled himself off of the couch, tugging down his
red hoodie, and brushing it off a bit. "Were you serious about getting
pizza for dinner?"

Plucky smiled, also pulling himself off of the couch. "You bet I was.
But I'd be down for ribs, too," said the duck, wiggling his fingers
around in the air in front of Buster, with a big smirk on his face. The
bunny countered with a well-aimed jab to said ribs. This caused the duck
to jump and let out a small quack, which got Buster chuckling. Plucky
slapped away Buster's paw. "H-hey, duck ribs are off the table, bucko!"

"Alright, pizza sounds good," Buster said, walking towards the entry way
to fetch his car keys. Now, unlike earlier, the rabbit kept a smile on
his face. "I'll race you to the car!"

The green duck nodded. "First one there picks the toppings?"

"You're on!"

The two toons ran out of their dorm room, their laughter echoing
throughout the hallway. It may have been a dark, cold, wintery night,
but at least they weren't going to be spending it moping around. Plucky
might have been a self-centered, self-serving duck most of the time, but
when the situation called for it, he could change his tune if he felt
like it. And even if he found Buster annoying most of the time, at least
he could tell himself that he did something good that day to cheer him
up.
