Hi everyone.

I can't get into the details, but if you've been wondering where I've been over the past several months, whether it be on Telegram, Discord, Bluesky, VRchat... etc...

I have been dealing with a _really bad_ online harasser for several months now. I can't talk about it, but legal avenues are being explored.

I have been under an immense amount of stress lately and it's making me sick. **So apologies to all the people I've been ghosting, the groups I've been absent from, and the friends who I haven't been hanging out with.** My energy levels have been low lately and my attention has been spread very thin.

Let's just say it's been bad enough that I am currently seeking therapy.

Don't worry, I will be "okay" in the long term. I didn't even want to say this much, or really make a post about it at all, but I don't want to let this person silence me and force me to crawl into a hole forever. **I am stronger than that.** I just felt like I had to say something.

I'm hoping for the best.
