In 2024 I only uploaded one story.

In 2025 I want to do better than that. I have been doing a little bit of practice writing here and there, but it's not stuff I've shared with more than a few friends.

I am currently writing a little story starring Flip and a new character. It's a little different from the stuff you normally know me for. ðŸ˜‰

I hope to get the energy to finish it this month. I had the idea come from a random dream, and thought it was really cute, so I figured I should 
write a full story out of it.

So yeah, I'm still around. Stay tuned.
