With Twitter basically dying (good riddance), deviantart being awful again, and FurAffinity still being shitty as always, an art website that has seemed to have gained some buzz is Itaku.ee. It looks pretty solid, has a nice interface and has a great tagging and rating system. It even has mass uploading!

As always, I'm wary with these things; who knows how long it will stick around, or the owner(s) will go crazy, or etc. So I'm not relying on it by any means, but I can use it as another place to put my commissions and gift art :)
