I made a new Telegram channel feed to mostly replace what I would use Twitter for, as I haven't posted to that site fully in forever now. Twitter sucks, tbh.

I'll probably use it to post commissions, thoughts, and ideas that don't warrant a full blog post, and of course, I'll link back blog updates to here!

Let me know if there's something in particular you'd like to see! ðŸ˜‰
