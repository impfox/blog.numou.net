I know I haven't posted much anyway over the past year, but I just wanted to post a quick update for anyone who comes across this site!

I haven't really written anything this year, or even commissioned much in the way of art. I've been focusing on working and trying to get my finances under control, plus I've been doing a bit of traveling and visiting friends. For 2024 I expect to be doing a bit more traveling and I don't know how much I will be doing in the way of writing, etc.

I'm definitely keeping this site online though, and I do still plan on using it as my main place to post things. I just don't know when the next update will be. If you still check out this site or come across it and you DO wanna see more stuff, let me know! My email and other contact info are linked to in the top right corner. You know how to get a hold of me!
